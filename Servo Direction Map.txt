This file describes how the servos on the KHR-1 should be directed to describe
poses. First it will describe how the servos should behave using our translation
library (you usually want this), and after that is the "raw" behavior if angles
are sent directly.

All given angles assume all servo not being modified are set to a T-pose like
posture, with both arms straight out to the sides, palms forward, and both legs
straight down, feet pointed forwards. (All servos are centered in this pose).

All angles are in degrees.

Translated inputs:
	We plan to use a "forward, up, out" standard for servo movements. Starting
	in the "base" pose described above, with all servos centered, all servo
	positions are set to 0. Servo ranges are generally -90 to 90 (not accounting
	for physical limitations for some poses). For any given servo, a movement
	that will move a limb forward, up, or out to the sides of the KHR-1, will be
	a positive angle, up to 90, and moements in the opposite direction will be
	negative angles, up to -90.
	
	If each pose is imagined as a set of individual servo position changes from
	the base pose, it's relatively easy to estimate all the angles for any given
	pose using this system.
	
	For example, to have the KHR-1 standing, with both arms straight forward,
	palms inwards, simply set the shoulder roll on both sides to 90, as it is a
	forward motion in both cases.

Raw servo inputs:

	Angles given for right arm and leg, left arm and leg move in the opposite
	direction.

	Head Yaw:
		0: Head pointed left.
		90: Head pointed forward.
		180: Head pointed right.

	Right Shoulder Pitch:
		0: Rotates arm palm side up.
		90: Rotates arm palm side forward.
		180: Rotates arm palm side down.

	Right Shoulder Roll:
		0: Arm pointing full rearwards.
		90: Arm pointing to the side (T-Pose).
		180: Arm pointing full forwards.
		Notes: "Natural" human arm range likely 180-45 front to back.

	Right Elbow:
		0: Hand pointed 90 degrees backwards.
		90: Hand pointed straight out away from body.
		180: Hand pointed 90 degrees forward.

	Right Hip Pitch:
		0: Leg pointed 90 degrees rearward.
		90: Leg pointed straight down.
		180: Leg pointed forward till it hits frame. (Hits frame at ~160 degrees)

	Right Hip Roll:
		0: Leg pushing in towards crotch. (Hits frame at ~80 degrees.)
		90: Leg Pointed straight down.
		180: Leg pointed 90 degrees out to the right side.

	Right Knee:
		0: Leg 90 degrees forward.
		90: Leg pointed straight down.
		180: Leg 90 degrees rearward.

	Right Ankle Pitch:
		0: Foot sole pointed 90 degrees forward.
		90: Foot sole pointed straight down.
		180: Foot sole pointed 90 degrees rearward.

	Right Ankle Roll:
		0: Foot sole pointed outwards away from body. (Hits frame at ~70 degrees)
		90: Foot sole pointed straight down.
		180: Foot sole pointed 90 degrees inwards towards body.

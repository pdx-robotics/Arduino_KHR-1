Control KHR-1 with Arduino

Using the VarSpeedServo library, observe speed differences of the write
function using a single servo. Test speeds in intervals of 10 starting at 0.

In specific, we will use the write function with wait=true so that we don't
write a different position in the middle of moving to the previous. We will also
alternate between degrees 0 and 180 for the greatest travel distance possible.
No delay interval will be used between positions.

Note that speed=0 will default to full speed.
========================
Observations:
(1) Speeds 10 - 80 are slow enough to allow the servo to move to the first
position before moving to the next.

(2) Speeds greater than 90 fail to move to the first position and interrupts in
the middle, moving to the second position. This is probably because the function
checks for the values written and not the physical position.

These speeds also do not show very much difference in how fast they move, but
results may differ in other servos.

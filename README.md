# KHR-1 With Arduino
The KHR-1 is made by Kondo Kagaku (近藤科学).

It will be modified to work with a Bluetooth module and an Arduino Board.

#### KHR-1 Hardware:
- Servos: KRS-784 ICS
- Servo Control Board: RCB-1

We will not be using the RCB-1 for this project. Servo Control will be done by
  Arduino

****
#### Servo Mapping
The Servos are mapped for reference as seen below:
